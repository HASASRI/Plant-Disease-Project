Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

🌱 Overview

The Plant Disease Detection System is an AI-powered solution designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals identify plant diseases early and accurately. By leveraging deep learning and image processing, this system enables users to upload images of plant leaves and receive real-time diagnostic results. The goal is to promote sustainable farming by minimizing crop losses, optimizing pesticide use, and ensuring healthier yields.

🚀 Features

•	AI-Powered Disease Detection: Uses deep learning models (CNN, EfficientNet, ResNet) for precise classification.
•	User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive web and mobile-based application for easy access.
•	Real-Time Processing: Instant results with high accuracy and confidence scores.
•	Extensive Database: Trained on a diverse dataset covering multiple plant species and diseases.
•	Image Preprocessing: Handles low-quality or poorly lit images using normalization and augmentation techniques.
•	Feedback Mechanism: Users can report incorrect predictions, helping to continuously refine the model.
•	Sustainable Agriculture Focus: Reduces excessive pesticide usage by detecting diseases accurately and promoting eco-friendly farming.

🛠️ Technologies Used

•	Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript

•	Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, Django (for backend), React (for frontend)

•	Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL

•	Cloud & Deployment: AWS/GCP for hosting, Docker for containerization

•	Mobile Support: Android/iOS compatibility using Flutter or React Native

📖 How It Works

•	Image Upload: Users capture or upload a plant leaf image.

•	Preprocessing: Image undergoes enhancement and normalization.

•	Model Prediction: Deep learning model classifies the disease.

•	Results & Recommendations: The system provides disease details and suggested treatments.

•	User Feedback: Users can confirm or report incorrect results to improve future accuracy.

🔥 Future Enhancements

•	Expanding the dataset to include more plant species and diseases.

•	Integrating edge AI for offline detection capabilities.

•	Implementing IoT-based sensors for real-time field monitoring.

•	Adding voice and chatbot support for farmer-friendly interactions.

•	Developing a multi-language interface for global accessibility.
